        <p>Hello! My name is Allie Garner and I am from West Jordan, Utah. I served a mission in Charleston, West Virginia. I am now learning about computer technology during my time at Brigham Young University Idaho. I have learned that I prefer cold weather over warm weather. I have also found a love for photography, art, and learning. I have four siblings and I love spending time with my family. My goal is to create a website that helps people with their health concerns.</p>

      <p>Utah is a state in the western United States. It is bordered by Colorado to the east, Wyoming to the northeast, Idaho to the north, Arizona to the south, and Nevada to the west. It also touches a corner of New Mexico in the southeast. The state is a center of transportation, education, information technology, and research, and a major tourist destination for outdoor recreation. Salt Lake City, the state capital and largest city, is home to the headquarters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
